# @app.route is a decorator around index() that means:
#   run index() whenever the user tries to access the "/" path using a GET request
#
# If you wanted the user to go to, for example, localhost:8111/foobar/ with POST or GET then you could use:
#
#       @app.route("/foobar/", methods=["POST", "GET"])
#
# PROTIP: (the trailing / in the path is important)
